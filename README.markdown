## Note on Docs
Docs are \*.tex files that are generated for the purpose of handing in work.
They are then generated using pdflatex.  All pdf files and the automatically
generated files are ignored by git and therefore are not included in the repos.

Documentation should be kept within the Wiki, and then when we need to hand
things in, it'll all be translated by hand over to latex, unless someone can
find an automated solution.
