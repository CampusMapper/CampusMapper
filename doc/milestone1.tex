\section{Use Cases}
\subsection{Meet a Friend}
The user wishes to arrange a place to meet a friend between classes.
The friend has communicated the location of their prior class, and the user
wants to find a meeting place between the friend's class and their own.

To do this, the user opens the Campus Mapper application, and enters the
friend's classroom into the search bar. The application locates the classroom,
and displays a menu with an option to \emph{Show location}. The application
then shows a map centred on the classroom. The user zooms out until their own
classroom is visible (marked by a ``Saved location'' indicator), and chooses a
suitable meeting place between the two. The user can optionally select the
chosen location and send it to their friend via email or SMS.

\subsection{Closest Wireless Hotspot}
The user wishes to connect to the university's wireless network. They would like
to know the location of the nearest wireless hotspot.

The user opens the Campus Mapper application, and hits the Menu button. The
application displays a menu containing a \emph{Find wireless} option.
The user selects \emph{Find wireless}. The application locates the nearest
university wireless hotspot, and presents a menu containing options to
\emph{Show location}, and to \emph{Get directions}. The user may select either
option; \emph{Show location} will show a map centred on the hotspot, \emph{Get
directions} will provide walking directions from the user's location to the
hotspot.
