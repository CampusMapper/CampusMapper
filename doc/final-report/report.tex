    \paragraph{The following report outlines the entire process of creating a mobile
    application for a Smartphone device that aids new university students in
    navigating the campus and surrounding areas. The main focus of the project was
    to develop a clean interface that is both intuitive and informative for the end
    user. Contrasting personas were created for the use-cases to serve in the
    development process and classmates were used as ‘experts’ for cognitive
    walkthroughs and heuristic evaluations. jQuery Mobile was used for the web
    application development and CSS was implemented for styling and layout design.}

\chapter{Introduction}
    \paragraph{Dalhousie University consists of 3 campuses that collectively cover
    roughly 79 acres. On those campuses there are classrooms, restaurants, Wi-Fi
    hotspots, athletic facilities and more. Our project was to build an application
    for a Smartphone device that would help students navigate the entire Dalhousie
    campus and easily locate some of the services the University has to offer. This
    is especially useful for new students who aren’t familiar with the campus as it
    can even provide turn-by-turn directions to a specific location. The main focus
    was the development of the user interface, which was designed to be intuitive
    for the tech-savvy, and easy to learn for those who are not. There two main
    stages for the interface design process that provided user feedback; cognitive
    walkthroughs using a low fidelity (paper) prototype, and heuristic evaluations
    using a high fidelity (Smartphone web application) prototype. Appropriate
    changes were made to the application upon the conclusion of each testing phase.}
\chapter{Background}
    \paragraph{In developing the system, design principles from previous
    academic research were considered. Academic research provided ways to design and
    use mobile phones for mapping and navigation applications, while fitting the
    needs of the user.}
    \paragraph{Fröhlich, Simon, Baillie and Anegg (2006) found, overall, users
    enjoy using mobile devices for geospatial activities and tasks. Indeed, in
    tests, users favoured the ability to get location-related information from their
    mobile phone—while filtering information-alerts to prevent the phone from
    becoming over swamped with alerts.}
    \paragraph{In addressing the problem of limited space present in mobile
    phones’ screens, Burigat, Chittaro (2005) used tabbed browsing when viewing and
    filtering information on maps. Users filtered information by selecting
    datasets—identifiable by icon—which would then place a layer of information on
    the map display.}
    \paragraph{And finally, Falaki, Mahajan, Kandula, Lymberopoulos, Govindan,
    and Estrin (2010) found that user interaction with maps tended to take the
    longest of all mobile phone activities. Their studies also emphasized the need
    to customize phone features for the user because of the huge diversity in
    Smartphone usage.}
    \paragraph{In addition to these design principles, similar design
    considerations were made when the prototype was being developed. Stone’s (2005)
    recommended simplicity, structure, consistency and tolerance design principles
    was implemented to assist the user in understanding and operate the system.
    Generally, the prototype was designed to follow similar mapping or mobile
    devices like Google Maps Mobile and Dalhousie’s Campus Map BETA. These design
    approaches within the system were tested in the subsequent cognitive
    walkthroughs and heuristic evaluations that was part of the iterative design
    process.}
\chapter{The Problem}
    \paragraph{The prototype was designed with the intent that it would mimic
    system that would be used for navigation by undergraduate students, between the
    ages of 18 to 20. These students, the system’s main users, would have varying
    experiences with computers and education, but all will have never been to
    Halifax before—and thus, the need for a guide for mapping information.}
    \paragraph{The requirements of the system were divided into primary and
    secondary requirements; however, not all were needed to be present in the
    prototype. The primary requirements were to show buildings, rooms and services
    on campus and allow users to select certain buildings for more information or
    step-by-step directions. Users would also be allowed to query the system, find
    local services or receive news-items. The secondary requirements of the system
    were to provide similar Halifax-wide information and allow users access to their
    personal apps.}
    \paragraph{To address these requirements, personas were created, who fit the
    main users’ attributes, and six use-cases were designed, to follow the primary
    functions. The prototype was then designed and implemented to support these
    use-cases and appear to support others tasks. To test the coherence of the
    system, experts completed a cognitive walkthrough and heuristic evaluation of
    the prototype—suggesting improvements to the iterative design and defined
    use-cases. Their involvement improved the overall design and effectiveness of
    the prototype.}
    \paragraph{The prototype was designed for a Smartphone application, which
    would support users as they traveled and provided customizable information or
    function depending on the user’s location. In following the use-cases, the
    prototype allowed service queries, room locations and step-by-step directions.
    An interactive map allowed users to select buildings for more information. The
    social aspect of the system allowed users to share their current location with
    their friends. A notification alert was incorporated to remind the user when to
    go to class or show news-items. Finally, users were able to save important
    locations in a favourites list. These functions supported the use-cases, and the
    prototype supported them through iterative design.}
\chapter{The Design Process}
    \paragraph{The following subsections describe the approaches taken when
    designing the system, including brainstorming sessions as well as the different
    prototyping phases. It provides good insight to how the system was developed, as
    well as shedding light on how user feedback and our own intuition allowed our
    platform to evolve throughout the months.}
\section{Brainstorming Section}
    \paragraph{Our first step was to decide on the topics needed to be brainstormed.
    We decided to look at two users [Rob Smith and Condoleezza Fernandez] from very
    different backgrounds, the applications primary functions and the application
    design. We used mind-maps to organize our sessions; this allowed for the free
    forming of information as it was expressed, while imposing few constraints
    [other than the specified topic].}
    \paragraph{Initially the mind-maps were done by hand on poster paper, but were
    then created in the computer for easier updating [if the user needs and
    software/user interface are changed] and inclusion in documentation. The users
    maps are detailed below:}
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/figure411.jpg}
        \caption{User 1: Rob Smith Brainstorm}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/figure412.jpg}
        \caption{User 2: Condoleezza Fernandez Brainstorm}
    \end{figure}
    \paragraph{When looking at user persona's we decided it would be best to
    create one at each end of the computer literacy and/or smart phone experience
    scale. We looked at two students; one who was born in Canada, taking Business,
    not very tech-savvy and likes to enjoy himself out. The other is an
    international student who is in Mechanical Engineering, very tech-savvy, money
    conscious and on the go.}
    \paragraph{The tasks we outlined during our initial design meetings were:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Find/browse for a classroom on campus
    \item Find the closest wireless hotspot
    \item Find my next class with directions from current location
    \item Notify the user if they are late for a class, as well as giving directions to
    the proper location
    \item Create a bookmark of the current location
    \item Find a local restaurant - the closest X
    \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{The software's architecture was broken down into two sections -
    it's primary functions and ideas for the design of the software.}
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/figure413.jpg}
        \caption{Primary Applications Functions Brainstorm}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/figure414.jpg}
        \caption{Applications Design Brainstorm}
    \end{figure}
    \paragraph{Our ideas were to either create an Android application, or an web
    application [which would allow for use on a higher number of platforms]. No
    matter which platform we would choose, we planned on using Google services
    [Maps, Search, etc] to simplify the application creation. This would allow the
    application to meet the primary and secondary functionality requested [showing
    campus buildings and services, local information, search, etc]. By building a
    Dalhousie check-in feature, we give the application a social spin.}
    \paragraph{In the end we chose to program the proof of concept application
    in HTML using jQuery Mobile as it is platform independent, there is less of a
    learning curve for the less experienced programmers in the group and it will be
    quicker to create.}
\section{Tasks and Users}
    \paragraph{User Task 1 Task 2 Rob Smith (M, 21) Find a hotspot View
    check-ins (social feature) Condoleezza Fernandez (F, 23) Find A classroom Late
    for class notification}
    \paragraph{The users were chosen from different backgrounds and histories of
    Smartphone use to provide a proper contrast for the testing process. Rob Smith
    is a 21 year old Canadian with no history of Smartphone use, and would be
    primarily interested in the social features of the application. Condoleezza
    Fernandez is a 23 year old mature student from Argentina who has a history of
    Smartphone use, and is primarily interested in the academic features of the
    application. These personas were used for the first testing phase of the
    application, where each user was given two tasks to complete using the
    application. These use-cases allowed us to employ the application from a user’s
    perspective and get a firsthand look at the applications functionality. Each
    task was assigned a scenario that would showcase the application in a real life
    setting. E.g. Condoleeza is studying at the Killam Library when the application
    notifies her that one of her classes begins in 15 minutes. She realizes that her
    class is just across the street and therefore has a few more minutes of study
    time. She selects the “Snooze” option which closes the notification. 5 minutes
    later the reminder pops up and notifies her that her class now begins in 10
    minutes. Condoleezza closes the notification, packs up her bag, and makes it to
    class on time.}
\section{Low-fidelity Prototype}
    \paragraph{When designing our prototype we decided to model it after many
    popular social networking applications such as the Facebook or Google+ iPhone
    and Android applications. This means using a menu bar across the top, for quick
    navigation buttons, confirmation buttons across the bottom, and grids of icons
    for menu options with-in the application.}
    \paragraph{We did a first draft on paper and pencil because this allowed for
    rapid development and easy changes based on group input. The drawings were
    scanned and re-created in Adobe Flash for better clarity, coloring and easy
    transfer into the high fidelity prototype later on. Below are examples of of the
    low fidelity paper prototype and the digital low fidelity prototype as seen
    in figure~\ref{fig:lfpaper} and figure~\ref{fig:lfdigital}}
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
            \includegraphics[height=3in]{img/figure431.png}
        \caption{Low Fidelity Hand Drawn Prototype}

    \end{figure}
    \begin{figure}

        \caption{Low Fidelity Digital Prototype}
        \label{fig:lfdigital}
    \end{figure}
    \paragraph{We felt that by taking design influences from Facebook and Google
    we could leverage some of the time and money they spent while designing these
    applications. Also, users of our application may be familiar with the common
    layout if they had previously used either of the previously mentioned
    applications.}
    \paragraph{We implemented a category dashboard that allowed us to group all
    of our applications tasks in logical groups so the user would be able to move
    through the application with ease.}
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
            \includegraphics[height=3in]{img/figure433.png}
        \caption{The Dashboard from the Prototype}
    \end{figure}
    \paragraph{Much of what was designed at this stage was kept, as we performed
    user testing most of what was changed was task names, slight icon changes, and
    the default screen that the application loads when it is started (straight to
    the map rather than the dashboard).}
\section{Cognitive Walkthrough Evaluation and Design of High Fidelity
Prototype}
    \paragraph{We next performed cognitive walkthroughs with our low fidelity
    prototype. During our walkthroughs, our testers found a few issues with our
    interface:}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The behaviour of the Find... button on the main screen (Figure
    \ref{fig:digital-dashboard}) was not intuitive.
    \item The Bookmarks label on the main page (Figure \ref{fig:digital-dashboard}) was
    confusing. The testers were not sure what type of the bookmarks the
    corresponding menu would manage.
    \item The marker icons on the Maps page (Figure \ref{fig:digital-map}) did not clearly
    indicate that they were clickable.
    \item The Social icon (Figure \ref{fig:digital-dashboard}`) was confusing, and did not
    clearly communicate the function of the Social page.
    \end{enumerate}

        \caption{Campus Mapper Map screen, before the cognitive walkthrough changes}
        \label{fig:digital-map}
    \end{figure}
    \paragraph{We decided to implement the following solutions in our
    high-fidelity prototype, to fix the issues that were discovered during the
    cognitive walkthroughs:}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item We removed the Find... icon from the main page. The Find page was renamed to
    Find services, and can now be accessed from the Map view (Figure
    \ref{fig:cog-map}).
    \item We clarified the bookmarks issue by re-labeling the icon, as Saved locations
    (Figure \ref{fig:cog-dashboard}).
    \item We switched from floating icons to "Google thumbtack" icons (Figure
    \ref{fig:cog-map}).
    \item We changed the Social icon to a compass rose icon, as suggested by one of our
    testers (Figure \ref{fig:cog-dashboard}).
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
            \includegraphics[height=3in]{img/cw_dashboard.png}
        \caption{Campus Mapper Main screen, after the cognitive walkthrough changes} 
        \label{fig:cog-dashboard}

        \caption{Campus Mapper Map screen, after the cognitive walkthrough changes} 
        \label{fig:cog-map} 
    \end{figure}
    \paragraph{We made two additional changes as we implemented our
    high-fidelity prototype:}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item We re-titled the building details pages, from the specific building
    name to the static title "Details". The building name is now contained within
    the dynamic portion of each building details page.
    \item We moved the bookmark icon (a star) to the top of the building details
    page; it is now adjacent to the title.
    \end{enumerate}
\section{Heuristic Evaluation}
    \paragraph{In the last round of evaluation, several changes were made, some
    of which seem minor, but all of which led to a better overall application. The
    largest change during this stage was changing the default screen the user would
    see, as many people wanted to have the map be their first point of contact with
    the application. There were also several name changes. All of the requested and
    implemented changes are summarized in this section, as well as the methods that
    were employed in order to generate these results.}
    \paragraph{The heuristic evaluation involved using our high fidelity
    prototype on a final subset of the class, in order to see how our changes
    between the low level and high level designs were being taken, and to gather
    feedback about what else could be changed. This involved letting two people run
    through our use cases with the new system, one female and one male. We allowed
    the person to make notes on a handout we gave them for each use case, as well as
    took notes ourselves in order to gather as much information as possible. We also
    discussed issues as we went along, and helped to guide the user through the work
    flows as needed.}
    \paragraph{As mentioned in the introductory paragraph of this section, one
    of the biggest features people wanted to see was the map view as the main page
    of the project. Also, there were several labeling issues that would be taken
    care of in this stage. As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:heuristic-primary}, we have moved from the
    main screen being a sort of dashboard to it being a blank map view. We have also
    renamed "Search Map" to "Browse...", giving a clearer implication of what the
    user should expect to see when they hit the button. Furthermore, it was noted
    that the Search query box on the find page was not very clear, and thus it was
    given a clear label and a border. The difference can be seen in figure
    \ref{fig:heuristic-find}.
    Also note, due to popular demand, school buildings have been highlighted blue in
    an attempt to make them stand out more. People were confused, and unaware that
    the buildings were clickable, and this new coloring scheme aims to solve this
    problem.}
    \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \subfloat[Old Main View]{
        \includegraphics[height=3in]{img/pre-dashboard.png}}
    \subfloat[New Main View]{

    \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \subfloat[Old Main View]{
        \includegraphics[height=3in]{img/pre-find.png}}
    \subfloat[New Main View]{
        \includegraphics[height=3in]{img/post-find.png}}
    \caption{Old and new find page}
    \label{fig:heuristic-find}
    \end{figure}
    \paragraph{Further changes are also evident on the dashboard. It can be
    noted in both figure \ref{fig:heuristic-primary} and figure 
    \ref{fig:heuristic-find} that the home icon has been changed
    to a dashboard icon. In addition, the help icon and saved locations icon have
    been removed from the content section of the dashboard. The help icon has been
    placed in the upper right hand corner of the dashboard, and the saved locations
    is now located solely on the map view. These changes can be seen in figure
    \ref{fig:heuristic-dashboard}. This was due to our own concerns, as we felt that it was redundant to
    have this in both locations. Also noticeable on the dashboard is the change of
    the label social, to a more appropriate title. This was due to people not being
    aware of exactly what social was intended for. Thus, we believe that 'recent
    checkins' allows for a more explicit term of operation. Finally, the dialog was
    given a line of text indicating the snooze time, as people were not aware of how
    long this would be set for. The new dashboard can be seen in figure
    \ref{fig:heuristic-dialog}.}

\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
    \paragraph{Beginning with a simple brainstorming session, the project started to
    grow legs. We took the results of the brainstorm and put together a paper based
    prototype, modeling the interface after similar products offered by Google that
    we ourselves has used, and deemed to be ideal. The paper prototypes were used
    for cognitive walkthroughs, giving the testers a firsthand look at the
    functionality of the application. The feedback from the testing was implemented
    to make subtle changes, such as the labeling or location of certain features.
    This provided the framework for the development of the high fidelity prototype,
    which was built with jQuery Mobile and CSS.}
    \paragraph{After rounds of testing and applying valuable user feedback into the
    development of our application, we had completed the requirements for the
    application, designed an easy to use interface, and had given it the name
    ‘Campus Mapper’.}
    \paragraph{As it was previously stated, our goal for this project was to develop
    a Smartphone application that helped new and returning students in navigating
    the Dalhousie campus. Since the primary focus was on creating a user friendly
    interface, the program itself is not fully functional, as there was insufficient
    time to make that happen in a single term. If we were to continue working on our
    application, there are a few minor changes we would implement to make it even
    more useful. First off, it was decided in the late stages of user testing that
    the program would ideally load the map screen on startup and have the user
    access the ‘find’ features from this screen, essentially combing the two most
    commonly used aspects into a single interface. We would also invest more effort
    into either creating or buying a set of application-icons that would be unique
    to our program.}
    \paragraph{The application we created could easily be extended into a fully
    functional website for the university where features such as finding directions
    could be printed off instead of only being viewed from a handheld device. This
    way Dalhousie students who do not own a Smartphone would still be able to take
    advantage of what our program has to offer.}
