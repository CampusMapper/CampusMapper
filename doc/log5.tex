\section{Tuesday, October 25}
During this meeting, we decided what work needed to be done for the weekend
meeting, and when that meeting would occur. We reviewed our use cases and
discussed the changes that needed to be made in order to match the proper
format. We decided to meet Friday to implement the low fidelity prototype.

\section{Friday, October 28}
The goal for this meeting was to complete the rough draft of the Low Fidelity
prototype. We modified several use cases to better fit the requirements; we
added a social aspect, and clarified the actions. We assigned tasks to the group
members to be completed for the Milestone 2 report.
